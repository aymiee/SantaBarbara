In a wrong location, one will not attract the amount of customers needed to stay in business. A location near a busy restaurant, movie theatre or any place that will increase traffic in the vicinity of your store is ideal.   Good location decisions can  significantly boost a company's long-term performance.   Since bookstores typically have low margins, other anciallary sales such as stationary, tee shirts, gifts, coffee, snacks are important to grow sales.  "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "I've lived in Santa Barbara for over sixteen years. One of my favorite past times was taking my daughter to the Border's book store downtown and spending a couple of hours browsing for books, watching my daughter partake in children events, perusing gifts, and enjoying a drink and snack or meet up with friends for coffee. Border closed its door back in 2011 and since then, we've frequented other independent book stores, but not with the same intensity.  We don't linger for hours like we used to.   \n    \nSanta Barbara is a small city 90 miles north of Los Angeles.  It's roughly 42 square miles compared to 468.7 sq miles of Los Angeles. Santa Barbara has roughly 30 neighborhoods. I put together a list of the neighborhood in Santa Barbara and used Google maps to manually capture the coordinates. <br>Some may or may not have their own unique list of venues. I will use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to cluster the \nneighborhoods into similar groups.   Next we will try to determine our ideal neighborhood by comparing the population, number of bookstores and venues in each neighborhood. <br> Our ideal location will be next to busy venues to drive traffic in the book store.\n\nThe objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for a book store using Foursquare API and census data. <br>I will look at spending power, rent, venues and competition, across each neighbourhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<h3> 1.2 Benefits"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Santa Barbara, often regarded as the American Riviera, is home to a beautiful landscape and great climate for living, playing and working. Santa Barbara is well known for its strong sense of community, agricultural land, myriad of wineries, and attractive cultural and tourism opportunties.
